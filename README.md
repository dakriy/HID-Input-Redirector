# HID-Input-Redirector

This is a simple windows application to redirect all input from an HID device to a window whether the window is in focus or not.

## Use case
Sometimes when hosting presentations from a multi screen computer with a remote HID presentation clicker, it is useful to do other things on the computer on a different screen while a presentation is happening. This of course takes focus from the presentation software. This program sends input from your presentation hardware to your presentation software even if it is not in focus.
